# minetest-autocool_lava
Do you play Minetest? Do you *hate* lava? Then this mod is for you.

## What it does

Lava source automatically cools to obsidian. Flowing lava automatically cools to air (*not* any type of stone). Also, obsidian glows because I think that glowing obsidian is cool.

## How to use it

Rename the directory to `autocool_lava` (Minetest doesn't like dashes), copy it to your mods directory, and enable it in the main Minetest menu. Hey, presto!, no more lava!
